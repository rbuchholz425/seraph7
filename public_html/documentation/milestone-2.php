<h1>Content Strategy</h1>

<p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>

<h3>Welcome:</h3>

<p>
	This will be a one-line statement welcoming the user to the site with a logo or design next to it and a full text logo above.
</p>

<h3>About Seraph 7:</h3>

<p>
	This section will a quick short story about jumping into a new game.
	The feelings about how it can suck to play games without friends and how this site can solve that.
	I will talk about how easy it is to find new friends with this site.
	And I will ask the user to jump in and find some new friends and communities!
</p>

<h3>Discord Drop Down:</h3>

<p>
	Here will be a dropdown bar that links to several different discord servers on different popular games.
</p>

<h3>Contact:</h3>

<p>
	This will be a simple contact form for the user to contact me with new ideas or concerns.
	This section will also contain below it a link to a Twitter, Main Discord, and maybe my GitHub.
</p>
