My personal website project for Deep Dive Coding.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
* Great styling, I really like your background.
* You have the necessary info but it would feel more complete if you went into a little more detail like you did with the the technology section. 
* Your persona is missing a user story, it is a small section but it is still important. It expresses one very specific thought and almost anyone should be able to read it and immediately understand the purpose of your project.
* Your page is very neat and concise. Really well done.
